Networking is a prerequisite to professional success whether unemployed or not
 - [[Networking#The Purpose of Networking]]
Provides us with a community
- Like minded and smart people

### 1. Networking is a necessary skill to have in order to succeed and goes beyond collecting business cards

> Networking is not one off experience, it's a continuous ritual to build a garden/community of people to give and connect with

Networking is about establishing relationships and helping people
Giving a private email address after discussing women's challenges
We must be interested in the people we're talking to, not just what other person can do
- There has to be a genuine relationship, we can't force ourselves to like people we can't.
Networking is about the quality of relationships

### 2. Networking is about building a community and can be life-changing

It means crafting relationships, connecting with people, being part of community
Author booked herself meetings everyday for nine months to connect with new people, taught herself how to adapt given climate
Networking prevented her from isolation, introduced herself to 200 people
Treat networking life a job, get up early plan meetings
- Part of a daily routine, not a one-off, seasonal charade
Lifechanging - author landed her current job as president
- It's not about the end goal, I'm not all of a sudden going to be a senior engineer. But it's the relationships I build with others that I see what opportunities are out there and what I can learn.
### 3. To be successful at networking, you must know your goals and complete the necessary prep-work.

Where do you see yourself in next few months? Years?
- I mean I'd still either like to be a manager, or start my own business, I don't know how I can utilize the skills I have to start my own business in one that I'd enjoy
Short term goals - meetings with those in my field, discussing ideas, how I might be able to help them
Long term goals - Professional and personal relationship with colleagues, dream job, positive difference to others in current job; people you already know, want to get to know, companies you want to get to know
Non-negotiables
Mind's job - focus on end goal  - doing homework on person I'm meeting with
Body's task - take charge of emotions, be positive and cheerful, increase chances of success
Spirit - Focus on long term goals, where you see self in future, how help the person, and main points

### 4. Storytelling initiates networking and brings your work experiences to life.

Share anecdotes from professional experience
Start with an introductory email requesting a meeting
Mention who gave you their details
In the email, outline your work experience, what you are interested in working on, asking whether person available to meet up
Don't send a resume, only when confirming the meeting
During the meeting:
- Mention the conflicts you faced (e.g. manage to retain a client who was considering leaving services)
- Have a hero, you, but mention other helpful colleagues
- Create anticipation, after conflict - provide reasons why important
- Have a peak - tell them how you solved the conflict
- Have a transformation - How you change as a result
- Provide an explanation - Emphasize how you grew from the experience
Practice in front of a mirror

### 5. When networking in person, you must be fully present and control your stress levels

Mind and body should be present
Offer a firm handshake, the meeting should be enjoyable and something you've been looking forward to
Agree on a time and place that works - come with key points and message
Research the person before walking in, have questions
- Where is your company headed
- What responsibilities do you have
- How did you join
- How did your previous work experience support you in this position?
Listening is critical - see how it connects to my interests
Manage stress levels:
- Use eye contact
- Slow down and deepen breathing
- Keep hand movements to minimum

### 6. Networking effectively means building your portfolio
Portfolio: Introduction, business cards, resume and bio
Introduction: 30 second elevator pitch, tell short snippet about who you are, professional history, and goals
Professional bio to give - 200 words and more detailed 500 words
Write a follow up email thanking other party, send thank you email to person referred me

### 7. Networking involves taking risks and stepping outside your comfort zone.

Be prepared to turn naturally-occurring situations into a chance to network
Laurel Touby (Mediabistro) - started career as a writer, then moved to freelance work
- Started arranging weekly events with a freelancing friend where they could invite friends to discuss, turned into a networking event
- Turned into a job hunting and networking website, earn commission when employers would find someone
- Sold company for 25 mil.

### 8. Refusing to give up is key to mastering networking.

Becoming an excellent networker - day to day practicalities like meeting with others, being an attentive listener, following up and being ready to give back to others
- How do I give back to others?
Like learning a language - must put in necessary hours to become fluent, open to learning and gathering knowledge from contacts, react out and ask questions
Questions can be trivial - what holiday destinations, how to work a camera, help someone at company you would like to work at
Kauffman FastTrac - Muller attended 160 meetings and met 200 people, relationships need time and attention
