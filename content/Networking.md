### The Purpose of Networking 

### The Problem

- Being isolated and having stale ideas
- A fixation of having only a few relationships and being too rigid, rather than adaptable and evolving, making a dynamic relationship difficult.
- The past two experiences using Hired.com to find a job, which didn't require utilizing a network. In 2024, when layoffs in the tech industry are high and opportunities are very sparse, I can no longer depend on that basket. Networking makes a good safety net for finding new opportunities.
### Skills to exercise
- Being okay with meeting strangers, deepening relationships, and letting go when not a fit.
- Creating opportunities for new friendship, mentors, and projects.
- Balancing giving and taking
- Being open and adapting to new knowledge and techniques
### Benefits
- An expert or connecter for which others can ask for help
##### Giving - examples
- Connecting two people together:
	- Finding a lecturer for an event
	- Finding an expert for a problem

[[Chat GPT - Giving back to others]]

### Potential habits
